        <a href="">Coffee:</a>
        <div><img src="/assets/uploads/images/coffee.avif" alt="" width="300px"height="300px">
        <p>The seeds of the Coffea plant's fruits are separated to produce unroasted green coffee beans. The beans are roasted and then ground into fine particles typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee. It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. Coffee can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk, and cream are often added to mask the bitter taste or enhance the flavor</p></div>

        <a href="">Tea:</a>
        <div><img src="/assets/uploads/images/tea.jpg" alt="" width="300px"height="300px">
        <p>An early credible record of tea drinking dates to the third century AD, in a medical text written by Chinese physician Hua Tuo.[13] It was popularised as a recreational drink during the Chinese Tang dynasty, and tea drinking subsequently spread to other East Asian countries. Portuguese priests and merchants introduced it to Europe during the 16th century.[14] During the 17th century, drinking tea became fashionable among the English, who started to plant tea on a large scale in British India.</p></div>

        <a href="">Green Tea:</a>
        <div><img src="/assets/uploads/images/green tea.cms" alt="" width="300px"height="300px">
        <p>Generally, lower-quality green teas are steeped hotter and longer while higher-quality teas are steeped cooler and shorter, but usually multiple times (2–3 typically). Higher-quality teas like gyokuro use more tea leaves and are steeped multiple times for short durations. Steeping too hot or too long results in the release of excessive amounts of tannins, leading to a bitter, astringent brew, regardless of initial quality. The brew's taste is also affected by the steeping technique; two important techniques are to warm the steeping container beforehand to prevent the tea from immediately cooling down, and to leave the tea leaves in the pot and gradually add more hot water during consumption.</p></div>

        <a href="">Blueberries:</a>
        <div><img src="/assets/uploads/images/blueberries.jpeg" alt=""width="300px"height="300px">
        <p>Blueberries are usually prostrate shrubs that can vary in size from 10 centimeters (4 inches) to 4 meters (13 feet) in height. In commercial production of blueberries, the species with small, pea-size berries growing on low-level bushes are known as "lowbush blueberries" (synonymous with "wild"), while the species with larger berries growing on taller, cultivated bushes are known as "highbush blueberries". Canada is the leading producer of lowbush blueberries, while the United States produces some 40% of the world supply of highbush blueberries.</p></div>

        <div><img src="/assets/uploads/images/hot chocolate.jpeg" alt=""width="300px"height="300px">
        <p>Hot chocolate is consumed throughout the world and comes in multiple variations, including the spiced chocolate para mesa of Latin America, the very thick cioccolata calda served in Italy and chocolate a la taza served in Spain, and the thinner hot cocoa consumed in the United States. Prepared hot chocolate can be purchased from a range of establishments, including cafeterias, fast food restaurants, coffeehouses and teahouses. Powdered hot chocolate mixes, which can be added to boiling water or hot milk to make the drink at home, are sold at grocery stores and online.</p></div>

        <a href="">Strawberry:</a>
        <div><img src="/assets/uploads/images/strawberry.jpeg" alt=""width="300px"height="300px">
        <p>The garden strawberry (or simply strawberry; Fragaria × ananassa)[1] is a widely grown hybrid species of the genus Fragaria, collectively known as the strawberries, which are cultivated worldwide for their fruit. The fruit is widely appreciated for its characteristic aroma, bright red color, juicy texture, and sweetness. It is consumed in large quantities, either fresh or in such prepared foods as jam, juice, pies, ice cream, milkshakes, and chocolates. Artificial strawberry flavorings and aromas are also widely used in products such as candy, soap, lip gloss, perfume, and many others.</p></div>

        <a href="">Mango:</a>
        <div><img src="/assets/uploads/images/mango.jpeg" alt=""width="300px"height="300px">
        <p>It was previously believed that mangoes originated from a single domestication event in South Asia before being spread to Southeast Asia, but a 2019 study found no evidence of a center of diversity in India. Instead, it identified a higher unique genetic diversity in Southeast Asian cultivars than in Indian cultivars, indicating that mangoes may have originally been domesticated first in Southeast Asia before being introduced to South Asia. However, the authors also cautioned that the diversity in Southeast Asian mangoes might be the result of other reasons (like interspecific hybridization with other Mangifera species native to the Malesian ecoregion). Nevertheless, the existence of two distinct genetic populations also identified by the study indicates that the domestication of the mango is more complex than previously assumed and would at least indicate multiple domestication events in Southeast Asia and South Asia.</p></div>

        <a href="">Bibble Tea:</a>
        <div><img src="/assets/uploads/images/buuble-tea.jpg" alt=""width="300px"height="300px">
        <p>Pearls (boba) are made from tapioca starch. Most bubble tea stores buy packaged tapioca pearls in an uncooked stage. When the boba is uncooked and in the package, it is uncolored and hard. The boba doesn't turn chewy and dark until they are cooked and sugar is added to bring out its taste. Uncooked tapioca pearls in their package can be stored for around 9 to 12 months, once cooked, they can be stored in a sealed container in the refrigerator. Despite this most bubble tea stores won’t sell their boba after 24 hours because it will start to harden and lose its chewyness.</p></div>
